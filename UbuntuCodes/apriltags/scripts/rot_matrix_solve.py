    Solving homogenous matrix mapping between
        road camera coordinate from and back camera coordinate frame.
    Equation is R * mat_road + t * I = mat_back
        r is a 3x3 matrix with the columns corresponding to the pre-transformed translations (relative to mat_back)
        R is an unknown rigid 3x3 rotation matrix
        t is the unknown 1x3 translation between origins of the coordinate frames
        b is a 3x3 matrix with the columns corresponding to the post-transformed translation (relative to mat_road)
    Math is as follows:
        Assume the homogenous matrix mapping exists:
            Let T be the matrix consisting of the 3 columns [t t t]
                where t is defined as earlier
            
            Then the change of basis can be defined by
                R * o + T = p with knowns o & p and unknowns R & T
                    System with 2 unknowns requires 2 equations
            We require a second system with a pre & post transform matrix
                Note our R & T matrices stay constant, and assume our bases
                    o_1, o_2, p_1, & p_2 are invertible (equiv. to being of rank 3)
                Our system is defined as follows:

                    R * o_1 + T = p_1
                    R * o_2 + T = p_2

                Right multiplying by inv[o_1] on the first eq. yields
                    R + T * inv[o_1] = p_1 * inv[o_1]
                
                Similiarly on the second eq., mulitply by inv[o_2]
                    R + T * inv[o_2] = p_2 * inv[o_2]

                Subtracting the two equations yields
                    T * (inv[o_1] - inv[o_2]) = p_1 * inv[o_1] - p_2 * inv[o_2]
                
                Right multiply by inv[(inv[o_1] - inv[o_2])], yielding
                    T  = (p_1 * inv[o_1] - p_2 * inv[o_2])(inv[(inv[o_1] - inv[o_2])])

        Substituting into equation 1 (2 works equally as well) yields 
                R = p_1 * inv[o_1] - T * inv[o_1]

        Denote R_1 to be the rotation derived by substitution into eq. 1
            and R_2 to be the rotation derived by substitution into eq.2
        Diff = R_1 - R_2 (component-wise subtractiob)
        AVG = (R_1 + R_2) / 2 (component-wise addition and division) 

        Though T should theoretically be of rank 1 (repeated columns of a translate vector),
            experiment-based data may not fit as nicely for obvious reasons. Interpret T as
            necessary.

    This function returns (AVG, T, Diff)
